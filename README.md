The goal of the project is to deploy on my server a simple copy of the AirBnB
Only some of its features will be implemented

The project will have:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

The Console/Command_line interpreter:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etcâ€¦)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
